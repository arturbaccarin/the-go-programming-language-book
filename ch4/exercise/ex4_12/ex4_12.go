Exercise 4.12: The popular web comic xkcd has a JSON interface. For example, a request to
https://xkcd.com/571/info.0.json produces a detailed description of comic 571, one of
many favorites.  Download each URL (once!) and build an ofï¬‚ine index.  Write a tool xkcd
that, using this index, prints the URL and transcript of each comic that matches a search term
provided on the command line.
